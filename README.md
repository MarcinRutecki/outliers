Including outliers in data driven models could be risky. 
The existence of an extreme single misleading value has the potential to change the conclusion implied by the model. 
It is therefore important to manage that kind of risk.

This study explains six of the most popular outlier detection methods:

Tukey's IQR method
Standard deviation method
Z-score method
Modified z-score
Isolation Forest
DBSCAN - Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise
The goal of this study is to present some useful methods to detect and get rid of the outliers in a data set. 
Some of them are sensitive to extreme values like the SD method, and others are resistant to extreme values, like Tukeyâ€™s method.
